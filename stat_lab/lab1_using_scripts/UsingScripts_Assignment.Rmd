Construct a script that does the following: 
  
  1) load the movies data. Assume the movies data is in the current working directory. 
  2) Construct a barplot of the frequency of movie genre.
  3) Construct a barplot of the frequency of movie ratings (e.g. G, PG, PG-13, etc.)
  4) Construct a histogram of movie runtime length with 5 minute intervals.
  5) Calculate summary statistics with the `summary` command for movie box office returns, runtime, and the tomato meter. 
  
Use good commenting throughout the script to explain what the code is doing. Also, put a header on the script identifying yourself and the general purpose of the script. 

Save your script with the name "lastname_exercise1.R" (changing "lastname" to your actual last name, obviously) and upload it to Canvas.

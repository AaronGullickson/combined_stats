# Measuring Association

## Thinking about association

The primary goal of most social science statistical analysis is to establish whether there is an association between variables and to describe the strength and direction of this association.

--

- Is income inequality in a country related to life expectancy?

--

- Do stronger networks predict better success at finding jobs for job seekers?

--

- Does population size and growth predict environmental degradation? 

--

- How does class affect party affiliation and voting?

---

## Association vs. causation

We often think about the relationships we observe in data as being causally determined, but the simple measurement of association is insufficient to establish a necessary causal connection between the variables.

--

.pull-left[
### Spuriousness
The association between two variables could be generated because they are both related to a third variable that is actually the cause.

.pull-right[
### Reverse causality
We may think that one variable causes the other, but it is equally possible that the causal relationship is the other way.

### Two categorical variables

The **two-way table** and **comparative barplots**

--

### Categorical and quantitative variable

**Mean differences** and **comparative boxplots**

--

### Two quantitative variables

The **correlation coefficient** and **scatterplots**

# The Two-Way Table

---

## The two-way table

The **two-way table** (or **cross-tabulation**) gives the **joint distribution** of two categorical variables. 

--

We can create a two-way table in *R* using the `table` command but this time we feed in two different variables. Here is an example using sex and survival on the titanic:


```r
tab &lt;- table(titanic$sex, titanic$survival)
tab
```

```
##         
##          Survived Died
##   Female      339  127
##   Male        161  682
```

There were 339 female survivors, 127 female deaths, and so on.

---

## Raw numbers are never enough


```
##         
##          Survived Died
##   Female      339  127
##   Male        161  682
```

* It might seem like the much higher number of male deaths is enough to claim that there is a relationship between gender and survival, but this comparison would be flawed. Why?

--

* There were a lot more male passengers on the Titanic than female passengers. So even if they had the same probability of survival, we would expect to see more male deaths. 

--

* We need to compare the **proportion** of deaths among men to the **proportion** of deaths among women to make a proper comparison.

--

* Never, ever compare raw numbers directly. Instead, we need to first calculate a **conditional distribution** using proportions. In this case, I want the distribution of survival **conditional** on gender. 

---

## Calculate maginal distributions

A first step in establishing the relationship is to calculate the **marginal distributions** of the row and column variables. The marginal distributions are simply the distributions of each categorical variable separately. We can calculate these from the `tab` object I created using the `margin.table` command in *R*:

```r
margin.table(tab,1)
```

```
## 
## Female   Male 
##    466    843
```

```r
margin.table(tab,2)
```

```
## 
## Survived     Died 
##      500      809
```
Note that the the option `1` here gives me the row marginal and the option `2` gives me the column marginal.

---

## Distribution of survival conditional on sex

.pull-left[
| Sex   | Survived| Died|  Total  |
|:------|--------:|----:|--------:|
|Female | 339     | 127 |   466   |
|Male   | 161     | 682 |   843   |
|Total  | 500     | 809 |   1309  |

To get distribution of survival by gender, divide each row by row totals: 

| Sex   | Survived| Died|  Total  |
|:------|--------:|----:|--------:|
|Female | 339/466     | 127/466 |   466   |
|Male   | 161/843     | 682/843 |   843   |
]

--

.pull-right[
| Sex   | Survived| Died|  Total  |
|:------|--------:|----:|--------:|
|Female | 0.727     | 0.273 |   1.0   |
|Male   | 0.191     | 0.809 |   1.0   |

* Read the distribution within the rows:
  * 72.7% of women survived and 27.3% of women died.
  * 19.1% of men survived and 80.9% of men died. 
* Men were much more likely to die on the Titanic than women.
]

---

## Calculating conditional distributions in *R*

You can use `prop.table` to calculate conditional distributions in *R*.


```r
tab &lt;- table(titanic$sex, titanic$survival)
*prop.table(tab,1)
```

```
##         
##           Survived      Died
##   Female 0.7274678 0.2725322
##   Male   0.1909846 0.8090154
```

-- 

* Take note of the `1` as the second argument in `prop.table`. You **must** include this to get the distribution of the column variable conditional on the row. 

--

* Make sure that the proportions sum up to one within the rows to check yourself. 

---

## The other conditional distribution


```r
prop.table(tab, 2)
```

```
##         
##           Survived      Died
##   Female 0.6780000 0.1569839
##   Male   0.3220000 0.8430161
```

What changed? 

--

* Notice that the rows do not sum to one anymore. However, the columns do sum to one. 

--
 
* Because of the `2` in the `prop.table` command, we are now looking at the distribution of gender conditional on survival.

## Comparative barplot by faceting

## Code and output for comparative barplot

.pull-left[

```r
ggplot(titanic, aes(x=survival, y=..prop..,
                    group=1))+
  geom_bar()+
  scale_y_continuous(label=scales::percent)+
  labs(y="percent surviving", x=NULL,
       title="Distribution of Titanic survival by gender")+
* facet_wrap(~sex)+
  theme_bw()
```

The code here is identical to that for a single barplot except for the addition of `facet_wrap`. The `facet_wrap` command allows us to make separate panels of the same graph across the categories of some other variable.

## Comparative barplot by fill aesthetic

  labs(y="percent surviving", x=NULL,
       title="Distribution of Titanic survival by gender",
*      fill="gender")+
  theme_bw()
```

* We `group` by sex and also add a `fill` aesthetic that will apply different colors by sex.
* We add `position="dodge"` to `geom_bar` so that bars are drawn side-by-side rather than stacked.
* We add `fill="gender"` to `labs` so that our legend has a nice title.

## How to compare differences in probabilities?


```r
round(prop.table(table(titanic$sex, titanic$survival), 1)*100,2)
```

```
##         
##          Survived  Died
##   Female    72.75 27.25
##   Male      19.10 80.90
```

We could look at the difference (72.75-19.1=53.65), but this can be misleading because as the overall probability approaches either 0% or 100%, the difference must get smaller.

38% of passengers survived
]

.pull-right[
### Costa Concordia
![Costa Concordia](images/costa_concordia.jpg)

Roughly 99.2% of passengers survived
]

---

## Calculate the odds

The **odds** is the ratio of "successes" to "failures." Convert probabilities to odds by taking `$$\texttt{Odds}=\texttt{probability}/(1-\texttt{probability})$$`

--

If 72.75% of women survived, then the odds of survival for women are `$$0.7275/(1-0.7272)=2.67$$`

About 2.67 women survived for every woman that died.

--

If 19.1% of men survived, then the odds of survival for men are `$$0.191/(1-0.191)=0.236$$`

About 0.236 men survived for every man that died. Alternatively, 0.236 is close to 0.25, so about one man survived for every four that died. 

---

## Calculate the odds ratio

.pull-left[
### Odds ratio
To determine the difference in our odds we take the **odds ratio** by dividing one of the odds by the other.

`$$\texttt{Odds ratio}=\frac{O_1}{O_2}=\frac{2.67}{0.236}=11.31$$`

The odds of surviving the Titanic were 11.31 times higher for women than for men.

.pull-right[
### Cross-product method
| Sex   | Survived| Died|
|:------|--------:|----:|
|Female | **339**     | *127* |
|Male   | *161*     | **682** |

Multiply the **diagonal** bolded values together and divide by the product of the **reverse-diagonal** italicized values to get the same odds ratio.

`$$\frac{339*682}{161*127}=11.31$$`

Its always the odds ratio of the first row category (women) by the first column category (surviving) relative to the second row category (men).

* We just need to add an `x` aesthetic (in this case race) to the plot to get a comparative boxplot.

## Income and presidential choice

&lt;img src="module3_slides_measuring_association_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Calculating mean differences

Use the `tapply` command to get the mean income of respondents separately by who they voted for: 


```r
tapply(politics$income, politics$president, mean)
```

```
##  Clinton    Trump    Other  No Vote 
## 80.23021 77.33414 80.32673 60.94324
```

* The first argument is the quantitative variable
* The second argument is the categorical variable
* The third argument is the function you want to run on the subsets of the quantitative variable

--

The mean difference is given by: `$$80.23-77.33=2.9$$` Clinton voters had a household income $2900 higher than Trump voters, on average. 

---

## What about median differences?


```r
tapply(politics$income, politics$president, median)
```

```
## Clinton   Trump   Other No Vote 
##    62.0    64.0    66.5    44.0
```

Clinton voters had median household incomes $2000 **lower** than Trump voters. Why are the results different between the mean and median? 
--

.pull-left[
The income distribution of Clinton supporters is more right-skewed than Trump supporters so it has a higher mean but lower median. However, the differences are relatively small regardless.

## The correlation coefficient

The correlation coefficient ($r$) measures the association between two quantitative variables. The formula is:

`$$r=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum^n_{i=1} (\frac{x_i-\bar{x}}{s_x}*\frac{y_i-\bar{y}}{s_y})$$`

--

### <i class="fas  fa-compact-disc "></i> Let's break it down

--

`\((x_i-\bar{x})\)` and `\((y_i-\bar{y})\)`: Subtract the mean from each value of x and y to get distance above and below mean.

--

`\((x_i-\bar{x})/s_x\)` and `\((y_i-\bar{y})/s_y\)`: Divide the difference by the standard deviation of `\(x\)` and `\(y\)`. We now have the number of standard deviations above or below the mean.

### <i class="fas  fa-directions "></i> Direction
The sign of `\(r\)` indicates the direction of the relationship. Positive values indicate a positive relationship and negative values indicate a negative relationship. Zero indicates no relationship.

.pull-right[
### 💪 Strength
The **absolute value** of `\(r\)` indicates the strength of the relationship. The maximum value of `\(r\)` is 1 and the minimum value is -1. You only reach these values if the points fall exactly on a straight line.

.center[
### ⚠️ Limitations
`\(r\)` is only applicable for linear relationships

`\(r\)` can be severely affected by outliers

# What is a Distribution?

---

## The concept of a distribution

When we refer to the **distribution** of a variable, we are referring to how the different values of that variable are distributed across the given observations. 

--

.pull-left[
### `r icon::fa("binoculars")` Look at it

- We can make a plot that shows the distribution.
- We make different kinds of plots for categorical and quantitative variables.
  * **Barplots** for categorical variables
  * **Histograms** for quantitative variables
]

--

.pull-left[
### `r icon::fa("square-root-alt")` Measure it

- We can calculate summary measures of the **center** and **spread** of the distribution.
- We an only calculate summary measures for quantiative variables.
]

---

## Calculating frequencies

In order to display the distribution of a **categorical variable**, we first need to calculate the **frequency** which is the number of observations that belong to each possible category. We can do this easily in *R* with the `table` command:

```{r table-freq} 
table(politics$party)
```

--

Lets convert these frequencies into **proportions** by dividing through by the total number of observations. We can also do this easily in *R* by adding the `sum` command to the previous command:

```{r} 
prop <- table(politics$party)/sum(table(politics$party))
prop
```

---

## Proportions and percents

*R* also has a built-in function called `prop.table` that will calculate proportions automatically. We just need to feed the output of the `table` command into it. 

```{r}
prop.table(table(politics$party))
```

--

We can employ this "wrapping" feature of *R* to do some more tidying up. In this case, I want to `round` the number of digits and multiply by 100 to turn my proportions into percents. I also use the `sort` command to sort values from highest to lowest.

```{r} 
percent <- sort(round(100*prop.table(table(politics$party)),1), decreasing=TRUE)
percent
```

---

## How can we display distribution graphically?

### Do not use a piechart

### Use a barplot
```{r, echo=FALSE}

## Constructing a barplot in ggplot

We will use `ggplot` to construct graphs. Here is the full code for the barplot. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}

  theme_bw()
```

1. Multiple commands are linked together with `+` signs.

## Visualize quantitative variables with a histogram

```{r hist-example, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12}
ggplot(movies, aes(x=Runtime))+
  geom_histogram(fill="skyblue", color="black", 
                 binwidth=5)+
  labs(x="runtime in minutes",
       title="Distribution of move runtime")+
  theme_bw()
```

---

## How a histogram is created

--

1. We break the variable into equivalent intervals called **bins**. For a histogram of movie runtime length, we might use bins of 5 minutes width, so our bins would look like 0-5 minutes, 5-10 minutes, 10-15 minutes, 15-20 minutes, etc.

--

2. We calculate the frequency of observations that fall into each bin. Technically, we need to decide which bin to put cases that straddle two bins (e.g. exactly 5 minutes). *R* defaults to putting these cases in the lower category.

--

3. We make a barplot of these frequencies, but we put no space between the bars. 

---

## Code and output for making a histogram

.pull-left[
```{r ref.label='hist-example', fig.show = 'hide'}
```

* You only need an `x` aesthetic for a histogram which is just your variable
* use `binwidth` to specify the width of the bins
* use `fill` and `color` to specify the fill and border color respectively for your bars

# The Center of a Distribution

---

## What does "center" mean?

--

### Mean

The mean is the **balancing point** of a distribution. Imagine trying to put a column underneath a histogram so that it does not tip one direction or the other. This balancing point is the mean. 

--

### Median

The median is the **midpoint** of the distribution. At this point, 50% of the observations have lower values, and 50% have higher values. 

--

### Mode

The mode is the **high point** of the distribution, or the peak. It is typically much less useful than the other two measures. 


---

## The mean and the median

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=12}
temp <- data.frame(value=c(mean(movies$Runtime), median(movies$Runtime)),
                   measure=c("mean","median"))
ggplot(movies, aes(x=Runtime))+
  geom_histogram(fill="grey", color="black", 
                 binwidth=5)+
  labs(x="runtime in minutes",
       title="Distribution of move runtime")+
  geom_vline(data=temp, aes(xintercept = value, color=measure), size=2)
```

---



## Calculating the mean

The mean (represented mathematically as $\bar{x}$) is calculated by taking the sum of the variable divided by the number of observations, or in math speak: $$\bar{x}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n}$$

--

### `r emo::ji("scream")` Equations??!!

Don't panic! We will walk through what these symbols mean. 

--

* $x_i$: We use a lower-case letter like $x$ or $y$ to refer to a generic variable. The subscript indicates a particular observation. So, $x_1$ means the value of variable $x$ for the first observation. The $x_i$ subscripts means some generic observation's value of $x$.

--

* $n$: We use $n$ to refer generically to the number of observations. So, $x_n$ gives the value of $x$ for the last observation. 

--

* We use the $\sum (something)$ term to say sum something up. In this case, $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$ means to "sum the variable $x$ from the first observation to the last."

---

## Calculate the mean in *R*

 $$\bar{x}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n}$$

To calculate the mean we just sum up all the values of $x$ and divde by the number of observations. The `sum` command will sum up a variable and the `nrow` command will give us the number of observations, so:

```{r}
sum(movies$Runtime)/nrow(movies)
```

The mean move runtime is 105.2 minutes.

--

Alternatively, we could just use the `mean` command in R: `r emo::ji("sunglasses")`

```{r}
mean(movies$Runtime)
```

---

## Calculating the median

.pull-left[
### The Midpoint

* We just need to sort the observations from smallest to largest and pick the exact middle point of the distribution.
  * If there are an odd number of observations, there will always be an exact midpoint. 
  * If we have an even number of observations, we have to take the two values closest to the midpoint and take their mean. 
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
nrow(movies)
```

With an odd number of 2553 movies, the exact midpoint is the 1277th movie. We can use the `sort` command to sort and thene extract the 1277th movie by using square brackets:

```{r}
sort(movies$Runtime)[1277]
```

Alternatively, we can use the `median` command:

```{r}
median(movies$Runtime)
```
]

---

## Why are the mean and median different?

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE}
temp <- data.frame(value=c(mean(movies$Runtime), median(movies$Runtime)),
                   measure=c("mean","median"))
ggplot(movies, aes(x=Runtime))+
  geom_histogram(fill="grey", color="black", 
                 binwidth=5)+
  labs(x="runtime in minutes",
       title="Distribution of move runtime")+
  geom_vline(data=temp, aes(xintercept = value, color=measure), size=2)
```
]

--

.pull-right[
* In perfectly symmetric distributions, the mean and the median will be the same. In other words, the balancing point will be at the midpoint. 
* Skewness will "pull" the mean in the direction of the skew, but not the median. This is because the mean will need to move in that direction to maintain balance. 
* In highly skewed distributions, this can lead to significant differences between the median and the mean.
]

---

## Skewness can create large differences

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12}
temp <- data.frame(value=c(mean(movies$BoxOffice), median(movies$BoxOffice)),
                   measure=c("mean","median"))
ggplot(movies, aes(x=BoxOffice))+
  geom_histogram(fill="grey", color="black", 
                 binwidth=5)+
  labs(x="box office returns in millions of USD",
       title="Distribution of move box office returns")+
  geom_vline(data=temp, aes(xintercept = value, color=measure), size=2)+
  annotate("label", x=170, y=400, 
           label="The mean ($45.2 million) is more than\ndouble the median ($21.6 million)",
           size=4)
```

---

## Modal Categories

.pull-left[
* We don't generally calculate measures of 
"center" for categorical variables.
* Since the mode is the most common observation, we can make an exception for this case.
* The **modal category** is the most frequent category in a categorical variable.

# Percentiles and the Five-Number Summary

---

## Percentiles/Quantiles

.pull-left[
* A given percentile tells you what percent of the distribution is below that number. 
* We have already seen one example of a percentile: the median. The median is the 50th percentile. 50% of the observations are below this value.
* Percentiles are sometimes also called **quantiles**, but I will use the term percentile in this course.
]

--

.pull-right[
### Calculating percentiles in *R*

The `quantile` command in R will calculate a given percentile.  

To calculate the percentile with this command, we need to add a second argument called `probs` where we feed in a list of proportions. So if we wanted to calculate the 13th and 76th percentile of movie runtime:

```{r}
quantile(movies$Runtime, probs=c(0.13, 0.76))
```

13% of movies  are 89 minutes or shorter and 76% of movies are 114 minutes or shorter.
]

---

## The five-number summary

.pull-left[
If I run the `quantile` command without the `probs` argument, I get:

```{r}
quantile(movies$Runtime)
```

* The 25th percentile, 50th percentile, and 75th percentile are called the **quartiles** because they split the data into four equal quarters. 
* When combined with the minimum (0%) and maximum (100%), they create the **five-number summary**. 
]

--

.pull-right[
You can use the five-number summary to create a boxplot.
```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(movies, aes(y=Runtime))+
  geom_boxplot(fill="grey", outlier.color = "red")+
  xlim(-0.6, 0.6)+
  labs(x=NULL, y="runtime in minutes")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank())
```
]

---

## Anatomy of the boxplot

.pull-left[
* Use a single vertical number line
* Draw a box with a bottom and top at the 25th and 75th percentiles
* Inside the box, draw a thick line at the median
* The height of the box is the differencde between the 25th and 75th percentile which is called the **Interquartile range** or **IQR** for short.
* Draw "whiskers" above and below the box. These whiskers should be drawn out to the maximum and minimum values or a total distance of 1.5 x IQR, whichever is shortest.
* Plot out individual points that are beyond the 1.5 x IQR limit individually.
